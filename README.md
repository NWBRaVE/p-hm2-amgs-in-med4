> Rozum, Sineath, Kim, Bohutsky, Johnson, Evans, Pollock, Cheung, Qian, Wu, Feng. (2024).
*Synergy and antagonism in metabolic hijacking during bacteriophage infection revealed by genome-scale model.*

This README will be updated with publication/preprint information when it becomes available.

The baseline model is imported and modified (e.g., to incorporate phage biomass) in `generate_biomass_functions.ipynb`.

The remaining notebooks produce tables and figures presented in the manuscript. The Python file contain various utility functions for the analysis.
